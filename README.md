## Introduction

Hello! This is the Github repository for the BSc's Creative Making: Experience and Physical Computing Unit at UAL's [Creative Computing Institute](https://www.arts.ac.uk/subjects/creative-computing/undergraduate/bsc-hons-creative-computing#course-summary). 

In this unit you will be introduced to a range of different technical and theoretical approaches to designing, prototyping and fabricating interactive physical devices and installations that use sensors, microcontrollers, motors and more!

Any extra code or necessary resources will be added here throughout the duration of the unit.

## Unit Themes: Intimacy, Awareness + Play

Throughout the unit, we will be reflecting on three themes that can be interpreted in a range of different ways. They are: Intimacy, Awareness and Play. These themes are there to guide you as you work towards the idea for your final project submission. Think of them as a starting point, and feel free to rewrite or reframe them as you like.

## Safety

In this unit you will be working with electricity and electrical components. Safety has to be considered when working with electricity. When working on Arduino projects:

- Make sure that the Arduino is disconnected from its power source when you are attaching components, this power source maybe through the USB attachment to your computer or an external battery.
- All the projects in the book either use 5V (power from the USB) or 9V (through a battery). At this point you shouldn't go above this voltage for the Arduino.
- Before, supplying power to your circuit, always double check your connections, especially the GND(-) and Voltage(+) pins.
- If a component gets overly hot, or you smell burning disconnect the power supply from the Arduino.

# Syllabus

## Week 1 - 24th February: Anatomy of a Physical Computing project

The Moodle page for this week can be found [here](https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=48822#section-3).

- Hour 1: **Introduction lecture:** In our first hour together, you will meet Alice, get to know the Unit's learning outcomes, syllabus and themes, and understand various making processes including what makes a physical computing project. Slides for reference.
- Hour 2: **Workshop:** In groups, you will explore the Unit's themes, breaking them down together into technical (inputs/outputs) and theoretical elements (ideas and context). The outcome of this workshop is to have an idea about what you would like to explore, and set an intention for what you will write about for the first post of your Blog.
- Hour 3: **Watch/listen:** Use the [Moodle](https://moodle.arts.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=48822) to watch a prerecorded lecture on some of the different tools for researching and making physical computing projects. Slides for reference.

**Homework:** Create your Blog and write your first post! Your first blog post should be reflecting on your thoughts the from the workshop: What themes within Making and Physical Computing are you most interested in? What existing projects are out there that relate? What technical approaches (eg. how to control light, fabricating with 3D printing, wearables etc) are most relevant?
